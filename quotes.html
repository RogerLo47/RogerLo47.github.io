<p>The purpose of this HTML is to list out several quotes that I like, and will be updated over time. For instance, one of my favorite quote is from Prof. Richard Feynman: \\
  "You asked me of an ordinary person by studying hard, for get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course, I was an ordinary person who studied hard. 
  There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing and they learned all this stuff they're just people there's no talent a special miracle
  ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you
  say you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics and time I then he's become a scientist."</p>
