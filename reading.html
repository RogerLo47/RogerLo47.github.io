<p>This is where I keep the list of the books that have significantly influened me throughout the ages.</p>

<h3>Books that have deeply influenced me</h3>
<p>Most books in this list are translated into multiple languages. In order to be international, I'll show the English version here. The most strenuous one for me 
in the list below is &laquo;The Alchemy of Finance&raquo; by George Soros.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>By the way, here's an interesting commercial of American Express Card featured Akio Morita at 1985. Note that in the same year, the Plaza Accord was signed at
the Plaza Hotel in NYC, between United States, United Kingdom, French Republic, West Germany, and Japan. After that, Japan's real estate and stock market greatly
inflated. According to Forbes, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi (堤義明) and Taikichiro Mori (森泰吉郎) had become the world's richest person, respectively. The Rockefeller Center
was even sold to the Mitsubishi Real Estate by 200 billion yen. The bubble finally burst and stagnated Japan's economy in 1991. Another interesting thing is: the
Plaza Hotel was sold to real estate developer Donald Trump in March 1988 following a handshake agreement; the sale was valued at either $390 million or $410 
million. These information were reconstructed from several business books in the list above. As Shannon said: "I just wondered how things were put together."</p>

<p>At last, I'd also like to attach this link to the <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zt411p7Wc?p=1">Lectures on Business Philosophy</a> given by Masayoshi
Son (孫正義), at his <a href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/special/academia/">SoftBank Academia</a>. For the ones who pursue success relentlessly as I do, let's
encourage each others in our endeavours.</p>
