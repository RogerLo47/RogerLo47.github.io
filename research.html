<h3>Information-Centric Stochastic Network Scheduling</h3>

<p>This research is conducted under the mentorship of my thesis advisor, <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=942014">Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh</a>.</p>

<p>This work has been submitted to ISIT, which is now under review. The contents in this paper will become the mainframe of my thesis. This work considers "information-centric" 
scheduling. We can simply distinguish "information" into three dimensions, that is, the quantity, the quality, and the freshness (information age/delay). In this paper, we contrive 
the information quantity by distributed source coding and queue length minimization, and the quality by a newly derived information-theoretic bound and fidelity requirement. 
Recently, I'm thinking about adding in a new metric called Age of Information (AoI), which is likely to become the rest of my thesis.</p>

<p>There's an extended journal version as well with all proofs and details written. Whereas more evaluations should be added in before submission.</p>

<h3>Compass and Straightedge Construction on a Sphere</h3>

<p>Assume P as the set of constructible polygons on the plane, and S as the set of constructible polygons on a sphere. In this work we prove that P=S with some properties in spherical 
trigonometry and the technique of finite field extension. The proof was all done but hasn't been fully typed out yet. Below are some sketch diagrams made with LaTeX MetaPost.</p>
