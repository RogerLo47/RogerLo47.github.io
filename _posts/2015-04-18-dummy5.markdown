Here are several samples of my works, including homeworks, final projects, and presentations I've done in the lectures I've taken previously. Below I list out the courses I've taken through my masters and undergradutes. I am currently serving as the TA of convex optimization lectured by Prof. Borching Su.

Advanced (Straight A's): Queueing Theory, Game Theory, Matrix Computations, Numerical Linear Algebra, Convex Optimization, Quantum Algorithms, Selected Topics in Engineering Mathematics, Overcoming Uphill Challenges for the New Generation Entrepreneurs, Applications of Quantum Computation, Computer Simulation, Stochastic Calculus#, Information Theory# (# for audit)

Undergraduate: Algorithms, Data Structures, Graph Theory, Matrix Theory, Computer Networking, Probability and Statistics, Principle of Communications, Discrete Mathematics, Complex Variables, Signals and Systems, Computer Programming, Linear Algebra, Calculus (I)(II)

#### Numerical Linear Algebra
Here are some handouts and take home exams of the course, held by [Prof. Keh-Ming Shyue] at the Graduate Institute of Applied Mathematical Sciences, National Taiwan University.

#### Overcoming Uphill Challenges for the New Generation Entrepreneurs
This course was lectured by [Dr. Gary Wang]. Gary previously held many senior executive positions at 3Com in operations, engineering and manufacturing. He served as the VP of 3Com Corporation and the president of 3Com APR Operations. In this course we have to do weekly presentations on different topics related. For instance, in the first slides we introduce multidiscipline and multi-model thinking, which are important qualities emphasized by great minds like Herbert A. Simon and Charlie Munger.

As for the second example, I'd like to show the slides about IoT architectures as follows:

Lastly, I'd also like to show our presentation slides for introducing balanced scorecard.

#### Information, Control & Games (Game Theory)
This course was lead by [Prof. Shi-Chung Chang] in our department, in which I've once presented a paper about Stackelberg games.

#### Quantum Algorithms
Below I show the implementation results of the famous Grover's algorithm in 5 qbits. This is a graduate course of computer science department, lectured by [Prof. Wen-Chin Chen].
