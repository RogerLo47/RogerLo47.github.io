Welcome to Roger's personal website. The main purpose of this website is to enhance my applications towards the MPhil/PhD programs. Professors can access to not only my personal information, my CV, yet many more dimensions of this student (that is, me). Since Professors are usually very busy and have lots of tasks to deal with beyond researches, I hope this simple, concise, and clear personal website can reduce their burden. I started building this website after receiving the interview request in 9, March, from the University of Cambridge. I've also applied for other great universities like the University of Edinburgh, UCL, King's and Imperial. All final results are not revealed so far.
