Welcome to Roger's personal website. The main purpose of this website is to enhance my applications towards the MPhil/PhD programs. Professors can access to not only my personal information, my CV, yet many more dimensions of this student (that is, me). Since Professors are usually very busy and have lots of tasks to deal with beyond researches, I hope this simple, concise, and clear personal website can reduce their burden. I started building this website after receiving the interview request in 9, March, from the University of Cambridge. Apart from this I've also applied for other great universities like the University of Edinburgh, UCL, King's and Imperial. All final results are not revealed so far.

I set up a very simple self introduction in 'About'. My research progress lies in 'Publications'. Please access all my posts through the homepage or 'Archives', in which I shows several posts on my works, presentation slides, courses taken, extracurricular performances, and specificially there's a post about how I build up my mindset and philosophy. Last but not least, you may recognize a more stereoscopic me though my treasured 'Quotes' and 'Photos'. Thank you for browsing this website.
