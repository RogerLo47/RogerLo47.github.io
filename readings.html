<p>This is where I keep the list of the books that have significantly influened me throughout the ages.</p>

### Books that have deeply influenced me
Most books in this list are translated into multiple languages. In order to be international, I'll show the English version here. The most strenuous one for me in the list below is <<The Alchemy of Finance>> by George Soros.

</ul>

<br>

Besides, I'd also like to show my wish list. Many of them are displayed in the souvenir shop in the [Computer History Museum], Mountain View, CA. I hope I can squeeze out some free time, get a cup of coffee, and go through these books in the future.

<ul>
  <li>[Philosophy of Information]</li>
  <li>[The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood] by James Gleick</li>
  <li>[Marconi: The Man Who Networked the World] by Marc Raboy</li>
  <li>[: The Man Who Networked the World] by Marc Raboy</li>
  <li>[A. P. Giannini: The People's Banker] by Francesca Valente</li>
  <li>[Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side] by Howard Marks</li>
  <li>[Adaptive Markets: Financial Evolution at the Speed of Thought] by Andrew W. Lo</li>
  <li>[Starting Up Silicon Valley: How ROLM Became a Cultural Icon and Fortune 500 Company] by Katherine Maxfield</li>
  <li>[Troublemakers: Silicon Valley's Coming of Age] by Leslie Berlin</li>
  <li>[Barbarians at the Gate] by Bryan Burrough, John Helyar</li>
  <li>[King of Capital: The Remarkable Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone] by David Carey and John E. Morris</li>
  <li>[Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet] by Katie Hafner</li>
  <li>[How to Be Rich] by J. Paul Getty</li>
  <li>[Trump: The Art of the Deal] by Donald Trump and Tony Schwartz</li>
  <li>[Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony] by Akio Morita (盛田昭夫)</li>
</ul>

<br>

By the way, here's an interesting commercial of American Express Card featured Akio Morita at 1985. Note that in the same year, the Plaza Accord was signed at the Plaza Hotel in NYC, between United States, United Kingdom, French Republic, West Germany, and Japan. After that, Japan's real estate and stock market greatly inflated. According to Forbes, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi (堤義明) and Taikichiro Mori (森泰吉郎) had become the world's richest person, respectively. The Rockefeller Center was even sold to the Mitsubishi Real Estate by 200 billion yen. The bubble finally burst and stagnated Japan's economy in 1991. Another interesting thing is: the Plaza Hotel was sold to real estate developer Donald Trump in March 1988 following a handshake agreement; the sale was valued at either $390 million or $410 million. These information were reconstructed from several business books in the list above. As Shannon said: "I just wondered how things were put together."

At last, I'd also like to attach this link to the [26 Lectures on Business Philosophy] given by Masayoshi Son (孫正義), at his [SoftBank Academia], for the ones who pursue success relentlessly as I do. Let us encourage each others in our endeavours.
